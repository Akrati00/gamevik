**PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)** is a groundbreaking battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation. It revolutionized the gaming landscape when it introduced a new form of competitive gameplay, combining elements of survival and combat in a large-scale open-world environment.
